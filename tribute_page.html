    "Deus me faça brasileiro, criador e criatura <br />

    Do meu corpo em movimento, as três graças do Brasil<br />

    Antônio Carlos Moreira Pires (July 8, 1947 – April 13, 2020), better known as Moraes Moreira [mo.ˈɾajs mu.ˈɾej.ɾa], was a Brazilian musician and singer. During the 1970s he played guitar and sang in the band Novos Baianos, after which he embarked on a solo career recording 29 albums. Moreira was involved in recording 40 full-length albums with Os Novos Baianos and Trio Elétrico Dodô e Osmar, and two more albums with guitarist Pepeu Gomes. Moreira was one of the most versatile composers of Brazil, mixing the genres of rock, samba, choro, frevo, baião, and classical. (From Wikipedia)
